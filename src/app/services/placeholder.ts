/**
 * Services Directory
 *
 * This directory should contain service files that encapsulate business logic
 * and handle complex operations. Services typically:
 *
 * - Implement core business logic
 * - Handle third-party integrations (payments, email, etc.)
 * - Process data transformations
 * - Manage external API calls
 * - Coordinate between multiple repositories
 *
 * Example files that should go here:
 * - userService.ts
 * - authService.ts
 * - paymentService.ts
 * - emailService.ts
 * - stripeService.ts
 * - aiService.ts
 *
 * Remove this placeholder file once you add your first service.

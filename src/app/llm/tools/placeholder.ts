/**
 * LLM Tools Directory
 *
 * This directory should contain tool definitions and functions that can be
 * called by Large Language Models (LLMs) to extend their capabilities.
 * Tools typically:
 *
 * - Define function schemas for LLM function calling
 * - Implement actual tool execution logic
 * - Handle tool parameters and validation
 * - Return structured data to the LLM
 * - Integrate with external APIs and services
 *
 * Example files that should go here:
 * - webSearch.ts (web search functionality)
 * - calculator.ts (mathematical calculations)
 * - emailSender.ts (send emails via API)
 * - databaseQuery.ts (query database safely)
 * - fileReader.ts (read and process files)
 * - weatherApi.ts (get weather information)
 * - calendarApi.ts (calendar integration)
 * - paymentProcessor.ts (handle payments)
 *
 * Tool structure typically includes:
 * - Tool definition with name, description, parameters
 * - Input validation and sanitization
 * - Execution function
 * - Error handling and logging
 * - Response formatting for LLM consumption
 *
 * Remove this placeholder file once you add your first tool.
